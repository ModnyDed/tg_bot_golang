# tg_bot_golang
The bot saves the links entered by the user through the dialog box, and the bot will send a random article through the dialog after the nth time.
For the start, you need to get your telegram bot's api from BotFather and write this command on terminal:  
go build -o project.exe
.\project -tg-bot-token 'YOUR API'
